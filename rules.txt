every unit behaviour should be a node with a script
all references whould be @export var
signals should be made with a .connect to an @export var
nodes can be grouped together. The parent node should not have a script. This behaviour should be contained within a child node.
editable schildren should only have their @export var(s) changed and be referenced by other scripts in the other script's @export var(s).
for example, editable children should not be deleted, or have scripts added to them.
if editable children would need to be deleted, that group of nodes should not be used.
if a script is needed, it should be added as another node and reference the required nodes
all scripts should have a class_name
scripts may inherit only godot nodes

possibly:

scripts should only be used on nodes, not godot nodes like characterbody2d and camera, etc
or
scripts on godot nodes like characterbody2d and camera, etc should only have @export var(s) to add attributes
these scripts are "reference scripts". They should inherit Node

scripts may only inherit node

there are some scripts which just have attributes. these are value scripts
